## Purpose

Chris is a personal workflow manager that turns ideas into shipped code through the `/wf-*` pipeline.

## Current Focus

Maintain stable workflow behavior, clear docs, and cross-agent parity between Claude and OpenAI skill packs.

## Conventions

- Keep `skills/` and `agents/skills/` behaviorally aligned.
- Prefer `AGENTS.md` for repo context and `CLAUDE.md` for Claude global context.

## Key Files

- `README.md` - public-facing setup and workflow overview
- `CLAUDE.md` - Claude-specific global context
- `skills/chris-guide/SKILL.md` - complete workflow reference
