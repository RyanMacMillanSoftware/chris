# /wf-new

Create a new project in the Chris registry. A project is a unit of work — it may span multiple repos.

`$ARGUMENTS` — optional project name

## Steps

**1. Get the project name**

If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, use it as the project name. Otherwise ask: "What's the project name?"

Slugify the name: lowercase, replace spaces and special characters with hyphens, strip anything non-alphanumeric except hyphens. Examples: "API Refactor" → `api-refactor`, "My App v2!" → `my-app-v2`.

**2. Check for conflicts**

If `~/Code/chris/projects/<slug>/` already exists, print:
```
❌ Project '<slug>' already exists at ~/Code/chris/projects/<slug>/
Run /wf-status to see its current stage.
```
Then stop.

**3. Create project metadata directory**

Create `~/Code/chris/projects/<slug>/` and write `status.json`:

```json
{
  "project": "<name>",
  "slug": "<slug>",
  "stage": "new",
  "repos": [],
  "branch": "chris/<slug>",
  "worktrees": {},
  "active_agents": [],
  "conflicts": [],
  "pr_url": null,
  "created": "<current ISO8601 timestamp>",
  "updated": "<current ISO8601 timestamp>"
}
```

**4. Ask about a new repo**

Ask: "Does this project need a new repo to be created? (y/n)"

**If yes:**

Ask: "What should the repo be named?" (suggest `<slug>` as default)

Then scaffold the new repo:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/Code/<repo-name>
cd ~/Code/<repo-name>
git init
git checkout -b main
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: init"
```

Copy `~/Code/chris/templates/AGENTS.md` to `~/Code/<repo-name>/AGENTS.md` and pre-fill:
- `name:` → the repo display name
- `slug:` → the repo slug
- `repo:` → `~/Code/<repo-name>`

Set up local agent runtime paths and ignore rules:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/Code/<repo-name>/.agents
ln -sfn ~/Code/chris/agents/skills ~/Code/<repo-name>/.agents/skills
touch ~/Code/<repo-name>/.gitignore
rg -qxF ".claude/" ~/Code/<repo-name>/.gitignore || echo ".claude/" >> ~/Code/<repo-name>/.gitignore
rg -qxF ".agents/" ~/Code/<repo-name>/.gitignore || echo ".agents/" >> ~/Code/<repo-name>/.gitignore
```

Tell the user: "I've created `~/Code/<repo-name>/`. Please fill in the AGENTS.md with your stack, install command, and any initial notes. I'll wait."

Wait for confirmation before continuing.

**If no:**

Print: "Repos will be identified during /wf-tasks when you break the spec into tasks."

**5. AgentOS install (optional)**

Ask: "Set up AgentOS standards in this repo? (y/n)"

- **If y:**
  1. Read `agent_os_path` from `~/.chris/config.yml`. If the file does not exist or the key is not set, print:
     ```
     ⚠️  AgentOS path not configured. Run /wf-init to set it up, or clone
         AgentOS and run the install script manually:
         git clone https://github.com/buildermethods/agent-os ~/your/path/agent-os
         bash ~/your/path/agent-os/scripts/project-install.sh
     ```
     Then skip the AgentOS install step.
  2. If the path is configured and the directory exists on disk, run from the repo directory:
     ```bash
     bash <agent-os-path>/scripts/project-install.sh
     ```
  3. Print:
     ```
     ✅ AgentOS installed in ~/Code/<repo>/agent-os/
        Run /discover-standards inside <repo> to extract standards from your codebase.
        Edit agent-os/standards/global/tech-stack.md to document your stack.
     ```
- **If n:** Skip silently.

**6. Taskfile.yml generation (optional)**

Ask: "Generate a Taskfile.yml for this repo? (y/n)"

- **If y:** Write `Taskfile.yml` to the repo root with the content below (substitute the project slug for `<project-slug>`). Commit it alongside AGENTS.md.
  ```yaml
  # Generated by Chris /wf-new. Edit freely.
  version: '3'

  vars:
    SLUG: <project-slug>

  tasks:
    prd:
      desc: Write the PRD
      cmds: [claude "/wf-prd {{.SLUG}}"]
    spec:
      desc: Generate the technical spec
      cmds: [claude "/wf-spec {{.SLUG}}"]
    tasks:
      desc: Break the spec into tasks
      cmds: [claude "/wf-tasks {{.SLUG}}"]
    build:
      desc: Spawn a build agent for the next task
      cmds: [claude "/wf-build {{.SLUG}}"]
    review:
      desc: Review work and open draft PR on pass
      cmds: [claude "/wf-review {{.SLUG}}"]
    status:
      desc: Show project status
      cmds: [claude --print "/wf-status {{.SLUG}}"]
  ```
- **If n:** Skip silently.

**7. Commit to projects repo**

```bash
cd ~/Code/chris/projects
git add <slug>/
git commit -m "docs: init project <slug>"
```

**8. Print confirmation**

```
✅ Project '<slug>' created.

Next step: /wf-prd
  Write the Product Requirements Document for this project.
```
