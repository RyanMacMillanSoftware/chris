# OpenAI/Codex Skills Mirror

This folder holds the Codex-facing workflow mirrors for Chris.

- Canonical context file: `AGENTS.md`
- Tracked mirror source: `~/Code/chris/agents/skills`
- Runtime repo-local target: `<repo>/.agents/skills`
- Global Codex install target: `~/.codex/skills/chris`
- `agents/commands/` is intentionally omitted in v1.

The goal is lightweight parity with the canonical workflow skills under `skills/`.
