# OpenAI/Codex Skills Mirror

This folder holds the OpenAI-facing workflow mirrors for Chris.

- Canonical context file: `AGENTS.md`
- Skills location: `.agents/skills`
- `agents/commands/` is intentionally omitted in v1.

The goal is lightweight parity with the canonical workflow skills under `skills/`.
